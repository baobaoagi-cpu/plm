# Acceptance Record

## Task 001 - Project skeleton

- Status: `COMPLETED` (2026-07-19)
- Python 3.12, uv lock, Ruff, mypy strict, pytest/pytest-asyncio, required directories, CI
- Pipecat remains the declared sole orchestration core; no production pipeline was implemented

## Task 002 - MiniMax WebSocket Spike

- Status: `COMPLETED` (2026-07-19)
- Provider calls: 3/3 approved bounded probes used; actual real-time cost unavailable
- Standard: PASS; two `task_continue`, `task_finish`, 24 chunks, 43,098 bytes, TTFA 3,921 ms
- Close: PASS with eight late buffered audio messages; cancellation value `INFERRED`
- Reuse: second same-session `task_start` `REJECTED` with status 2206
- Connection strategy: `ONE_SESSION_PER_GENERATION`
- Audio: MP3, 24 kHz, mono; full stream and first chunk independently decoded
- Secrets: environment-only; `.env` ignored; evidence and logs redacted
- Task 003: `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
- Project state: `NEEDS_HUMAN_MILESTONE_APPROVAL`

Final lint, strict typecheck, unit tests, JSON validation, architecture check, and secret scan are
recorded in `.loop/runs/iteration-006-reuse-and-final.md`.

## Task 003 - MiniMax Protocol Models

- Status: `COMPLETED` (2026-07-19)
- Scope: pure typed protocol models, parser, verified hex payload decoder, error taxonomy,
  redaction, synthetic fixtures, and unit tests
- Status 2206: mapped to `MiniMaxUnsupportedReuseError`
- Unknown events: typed redacted fallback
- Fixtures: 7 valid synthetic JSON files with no credentials or raw provider payloads
- Ruff: PASS
- mypy strict: PASS, 48 source files
- Unit tests: PASS, 47/47 (30 Task 003 plus 17 regressions)
- Provider API calls: 0
- Forbidden implementations: none introduced
- Task 004: `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
- Project state: `NEEDS_HUMAN_MILESTONE_APPROVAL`
